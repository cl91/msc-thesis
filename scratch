A multitude of theories have solitonic solutions. Two classes of these are the Sine-Gordon (and Sine-Gordon-like) theory and a generic polynomial potential such as the $\phi^4$ theory and the $\phi^6$ theory considered in the Amin paper on oscillon dynamics.

Integrable theories are usually studied with IST (inverse scattering method), while non-integrable theories are studies with various perturbation methods, one of which involves extending the IST method to treat non-integrable perturbation (see below).

A (non-integrable) generalization of the Sine-Gordon equation (and some other non-integrable theories) exhibits a notion called 'quasi-integrability'. It is worthwhile to investigate this further (see below).
$\phi^4$ theory is also non-integrable though is studied less in the literature. Therefore they are potentially more useful to look into.

\section{Sine-Gordon Model --- Exactly Integrable}
Analytic solutions are done with various forms of IST, though one of the integrable generalizations of the Sine-Gordon can be studied with a fundamentally different method (see below).

\begin{itemize}
\item Exact Solutions to Sine Gordon Equation using Inverse Scattering Transform;  These solutions are based on a "matrix" method (which is an equivalent but more manageable form of treating the soliton degrees of freedom), and include "breather solutions" which I believe are equivalent to oscillons

The matrix method is a different form of expressing the Marchenko kernel used in the IST.

\section{Sine-Gordon Equation — Non-integrable Generalizations}
The theory considered here is the Sine-Gordon equation with a PT-symmetric perturbation (making it not exactly integrable). The idea is that even with the perturbation it is still a 'quasi-integrable' theory which can be analyzed to have kink- and breather-like structures.
